A better way to save and organize the web.

Net is an extension to save links quickly and organize them as "cards" and "lists" in the style of a Kanban board. 
Net is designed to make link saving clean and intuitive, and save memory by reducing the number of tabs open.

FEATURES
Net organizes your links as cards which can be moved between reorderable lists.

Left click the Net icon in the Chrome toolbar to add the current tab as a card of your leftmost list.
Right clicking the Net icon will also give you the options to "send all tabs" and "send and close all tabs" of your current window to Net.

Right click the Net icon and "Go to your net" to access your saved links.
Once in your Net, you can easily create and name new lists and add new cards. Cards can take a URL, text, or both a URL and text, in which case the text will act as the card title.
You can also add lists and cards to your clipboard, import a group of links, and open a link or all of the links in a list with one click.

Net syncs between Chrome browsers through your Google account.

PRIVACY
Saved links are stored locally and not accessible by the developers

OPTIONS
Choose whether to open your net on launch
Choose between several preset themes

The information provided in this form will be shared with the Chrome Web Store team. Please ensure that the information provided is accurate, as it will improve the review time of your extension and decrease the risk of this version being rejected.

#### SINGLE PURPOSE

Single Purpose Description (1000 chars)

Saving and organizing links as drag/droppable links

Net is an extension to save links quickly and organize them as "cards" and "lists" in the style of a Kanban board. Lists and cards can be created manually in the extension page and organized by dragging and dropping. The extension icon can be used to create a new card of the current tab URL, or to create a list with cards containing all of the tabs of the current window. Links can quickly be copied to a user's clipboard or imported as a new list. Net is designed to make link saving clean and intuitive, and save memory by reducing the number of tabs open.

#### <u>PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION</u>

A [permission](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declare_permissions) is either one of a list of known strings, such as "activeTab", or a [match pattern](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns) giving access to one or more hosts.
Remove any permission that is not needed to fulfill the single purpose of your extension. Requesting an unnecessary permission will result in this version being rejected.

**tabs (1000 chars)**
