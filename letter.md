Patience

Things I want to do

Hi baby. It has been just over two months since we were together biking along the beach and with every day that passes, my longing for you grows stronger.

I'm doing my best to be as positive as I can be, knowing that in the arc of our lives, we may learn to look back on these few months as a time of growth, for ourselves, for our communities, and for our relationships. But it would be a lie to say that I am not also scared. Some days, the future feels impossible and the present feels unreal. I learned a long time ago that I have a tendency to push away conflict in uncertainty and I catch myself emotionally distancing myself from my parents. I feel paralyzed by anxiety thinking about the traumatizing events of this past semester, disillusionment with my education, isolation, widespread suffering brought about by the pandemic and police violence, and by the feeling of powerlessness and respective guilt I feel from my paralysis. This crisis also coincides with a time that would normally be a period of reevaluation in any young person's life. I think both of us have been struggling to determine what, of the things we do and believe, are from a sense of obligation and what spring from passion and joy.

I've been reading to cope and one of the books I am reading is Upheaval by Jared Diamond. It's a book about crisis, both personal and national, and one of the key arguments is that crisis is a story of selective change. Sitting alone in my room, in a space separated from any sense of normalcy, I've been confronted with the question of change. This is the first real time I have been made to reassess my values and determine the things most essential to my identity, and its been a tough, often crushing process. 

Of the many things I am learning about myself, one realization feels like something I have always known. You are fundamental to me. The passion and the joy that you are for me cuts through the surreal I can't imagine myself now without you. I hope the sincerity of these words reaches you through my 

You make me better every day and any patience . You are my rock.

Love,

Tae
